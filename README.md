# Printshop

A SvelteKit application that finds the oldest or newest printing of Magic: The Gathering cards and formats them for Moxfield import. This is a temporary tool while Moxfield finishes up their redesign that will include these options (and be much more efficient and user-friendly).

## Features

- **Bulk Card Lookup**: Paste or upload a list of card names
- **Oldest Printing Detection**: Automatically finds the earliest release of each card
- **Moxfield Formatting**: Generate properly formatted output for deck import
- **Foil & Tags Support**: Won't clobber your tags or foil data!
